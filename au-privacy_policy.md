# Privacy Policy

`Purpose` This document is a privacy policy. Before you begin constructing your privacy policy, there are a few key concepts you need to know.

From time to time, you’ll run into **Dilruk and Sasha**. They’re going to help us by providing explanations in some of the tougher topics.

**Here are 2 key terms that will be frequently used throughout this template:**

- **Personal Information** is any information that can be used to identify an individual person. Examples of personal information can include: a person’s name, address, or telephone number.
- **Provider** is the person or organisation collecting and using personal information.

Now we can talk about the **collection of personal information.** The **collection of personal information** happens in 2 ways.

The first way is when one person asks another person for their information.

- Dilruk asks Sasha; "Can I have your address so we know where to deliver this?" Sasha replies; "Sure! It’s 123 Alphabet Street." In this instance, Dilruk has asked Sasha for her personal information and so Sasha has given it to Dilruk.

The second way personal information can be collected is when a website or computer collects information automatically.

- Sasha uses a website to sell jewellery. Dilruk fills out an order form on Sasha’s website. Sasha’s website automatically stores the information.

There are multiple topics you will need to include whilst constructing your privacy policy. There are some topics you **must always** include in your privacy policy, regardless of the circumstances – these will be labelled as **mandatory topics.**

There are some topics that are optional to include in your privacy policy, according to your circumstances – these will be labelled as **optional topics.**

It is important that you carefully read through every topic and make sure that you have included and deleted the relevant topics according to your business needs.

## Introduction

**Mandatory Topic -** do not remove this topic.

This topic has 2 purposes:
- it describes why the privacy policy was created; and
- it sets up some useful terminology for the rest of the document.

### How Provider deals with the Personal Information of Individuals.

- Provider has adopted this Policy in accordance with the privacy law.
- This Policy outlines how Provider deals with Personal Information, which it collects in conjunction with the Services.
- Provider may also collect information about Individuals who do not use the Services.
- Capitalised words in this Policy are defined terms. Defined terms are explained at the end of this Policy.

## Collecting information directly from people

**Optional Topic**

People need to know how the service provider collects personal information. **You only need to include this topic in your privacy policy if:**

- People actively _give_ the service provider their personal information. For instance, a person might email a service provider. The service provider will then store that person’s email address.

Or;

- You automatically collect information. This is usually a function of your website or computer program. For example, Dilruk creates a profile on Sasha’s website, and Sasha’s site automatically sends the information to a database.

### Provider collects Personal Information directly.

Provider collects Personal Information directly when an Individual:

{{direct collection}}

## Collecting information from third parties

**Optional Topic**

This topic explains [who third parties are](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/third_party.md) and how the provider collects their information. **If the provider doesn’t collect information from third parties, you can remove this topic.**

Here’s an example of how this topic works. When Dilruk logs into his favourite news site, he sees a "sign in with Facebook" button. Dilruk clicks that button and Facebook receives information about him via his activities on the news site.

Essentially, this topic covers situations in which the provider receives information about individuals from other sources (like the news site).

### Provider collects some Personal Information from third parties.

Provider collects Personal Information about Individuals from third parties when:

{{third party collection}}

## Organisations using the services

**Optional Topic**

Sometimes, the provider will sell services to a second organisation. That second organisation will then use the services to collect personal information from individuals.

For instance, Dilruk is a website host. He sells business technology to a furniture company, "Banana Lounges". "Banana Lounges" use that technology to collect personal information about their employee, Sasha.

In this situation, the law says that both Dilruk and "Banana Lounges" are collecting personal information from Sasha. That means both Dilruk and "Banana Lounges" them need a privacy policy. **If this kind of situation doesn’t apply to the provider’s services, remove this topic.**

### Organisations use Provider’s Services to collect Personal Information.

Provider provides the Services to Organisations, which {{organisation activity}}. Both Provider and the Organisations may collect Personal Information from Individuals, including when:

{{organisation collection}}

## Types of Information that Provider collects and holds

And anything else that might be considered really personal.

- Where the provider uses the services of a third party to process or store data. This might be through the use of a server in another county, for instance. In order to lower his costs, Dilruk uses a server located in the Philippines to store his emails.

If the provider deals with people overseas, they should set up a contract to make them comply with Australian law. Specifically, you want overseas partners to abide by the Australian Privacy Principles. It’s a good idea to have the same legal protections for your data at home and abroad.
